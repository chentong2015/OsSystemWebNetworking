Why XSS Attack happen ? => 永远不要相信用户的输入
The use of untrusted data without performing proper validation.
The untrusted data is any data that user can manipulate.

TODO. XSS不同类型
1. Reflected XSS:
   服务端错误的将用户的输入作为Response返回
   Web Server takes user input and directly put it in the response.

2. Stored XSS:
   用户注入的攻击代码将被持久化到DB中存储
   User data is stored in DB and then outputted to the screen.

3. DOM Based XSS
   JS client side writes user control data to DOM without proper sanitization
